# BlackRoad Architecture Overview

> **The Core Thesis:** BlackRoad is a routing company, not an AI company.

---

## Executive Summary

We don't train models or buy GPUs. We connect users to intelligence that already exists (Claude, GPT, Llama, NumPy, legal databases, etc.) through an orchestration layer we own.

**The insight:** Intelligence is already trained. Libraries already exist. The value is in routing requests to the right tool at the right time—not in building another brain.

---

## Infrastructure (~$40/month recurring)

| Layer | Service | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| Edge/CDN | Cloudflare | Handles millions of connections, DNS, DDoS |
| CRM/Data | Salesforce (Free Dev Edition) | Customer data, 15K API calls/day |
| Code/CI | GitHub Enterprise | 15 organizations, deployment |
| Mesh Network | Tailscale | Private encrypted connections between nodes |
| Cloud Node | Digital Ocean (Shellfish) | Internet-facing server |

---

## Hardware (Owned, Not Rented)

A Raspberry Pi cluster running specialized roles:

| Node | Hardware | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| **lucidia** | Pi 5 + Pironman + Hailo-8 | Salesforce sync, RoadChain/Bitcoin |
| **octavia** | Pi 5 + Pironman + Hailo-8 | AI routing decisions (26 TOPS), 3D printing |
| **aria** | Pi 5 | Agent orchestration, Cloudflare Workers |
| **alice** | Pi 400 | Kubernetes + VPN hub (mesh root) |
| **shellfish** | Digital Ocean droplet | Public-facing gateway |

Plus dev machines (Mac = "cecilia", iPhone = "arcadia") and edge devices (ESP32s, LoRa modules for future deployment).

### Local Inference via Raspberry Pi 5 Clusters

| Component | Technical Specification | Functional Role |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Compute Node | Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB LPDDR4X) | General Purpose Inference and Control |
| Inference Accelerator | Raspberry Pi AI Hat 2 (40 TOPS) | Dedicated INT8 LLM Processing |
| Network Layer | Gigabit Ethernet with PoE+ HAT | Synchronized Node Communication |
| Storage | NVMe SSD (M.2 Interface, 256GB+) | Model Weights and Agent Memory |
| Software Stack | LiteLLM Proxy / Ollama / llama.cpp | API Hosting and Load Balancing |

The Raspberry Pi AI Hat 2, featuring the Hailo 10H NPU, enables efficient processing of quantized GGUF models, achieving 5–15 tokens per second in clustered configurations using OpenMPI for parallelization.

**Copilot Offloading:** All Copilot traffic is redirected to the local LiteLLM proxy:

```
export GH_COPILOT_OVERRIDE_PROXY_URL="http://raspberrypi.local:4000"
```

This bypasses external rate limits and ensures proprietary codebase context never leaves the local network.

## The Control Plane

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              BLACKROAD UNIFIED CONTROL                       │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
│   SALESFORCE    │   CLOUDFLARE    │      GITHUB             │
│   CRM + API     │   Edge + DNS    │    Code + CI            │
└────────┬────────┴────────┬────────┴──────────┬──────────────┘
         │                 │                   │
         └────────────────┬┴───────────────────┘
                          ▼
                    ┌──────────┐
                    │ OPERATOR │  ← We own this
                    └────┬─────┘
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
         ▼               ▼               ▼

         └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                         ▼
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │  alice  │  ← K8s + VPN hub
                    └─────────┘
```

**Key insight:** The OPERATOR sits between us and all external services. Cloudflare, Salesforce, and GitHub are utilities we command—not landlords we rent from. The control plane lives on hardware we own.

## The Routing Pattern

```
[User Request] → [Operator] → [Route to Right Tool] → [Answer]
                     │
                     ├── Physics question? → NumPy/SciPy
                     ├── Language task? → Claude/GPT API
                     ├── Customer lookup? → Salesforce API
                     ├── Legal question? → Legal database
                     └── Fast inference? → Hailo-8 local
```

The agent doesn't need to be smart. It needs to know **who to call.**

## The @blackroad-agents Deca-Layered Scaffold

Every task triggered by the `@blackroad-agents` command follows a 10-step scaffold:

| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Initial Reviewer** | Layer 6 (Lucidia Core) reviews intent, security, and resources |
| 2 | **Task → Organization** | Route to one of 15 BlackRoad organizations |
| 3 | **Task → Team** | Distribute to team; HITL pause for high-risk ops |
| 4 | **Task → Project** | Record in GitHub Project + Salesforce sync |
| 5 | **Task → Agent** | Assign specialized agent (Planner-Executor-Reflector) |
| 6 | **Task → Repository** | Create branch in target repo (GitHub Flow) |
| 7 | **Task → Device** | Route to Pi cluster or DigitalOcean for execution |
| 8 | **Task → Drive** | Distribute artifacts to Google Drive via GSA |
| 9 | **Task → Cloudflare** | Execute DNS/Tunnel changes for new services |
| 10 | **Task → Website Editor** | Update presentation layer via headless CMS |

---

## BlackRoad CLI v3 Layered Architecture

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| 3 | Agents/System | Autonomous agent lifecycle management |
| 4 | Deploy/Orchestration | Infrastructure provisioning across cloud and local |
| 5 | Branches/Environments | Ephemeral environments and git-branching logic |
| 6 | Lucidia Core/Memory | Long-term context, state transitions, simulation data |
| 7 | Orchestration | High-level task distribution (@blackroad-agents scaffold) |
| 8 | Network/API | REST and GraphQL endpoints for @BlackRoadBot |

---

## The Business Model

| What We Own | What We Don't Need |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Customer relationships | Training models |
| Routing/orchestration logic | GPUs |
| Data and state | Data centers |
| The Operator | The intelligence itself |

When better models come out, we add them to the router. Infrastructure stays the same.

---

## The Math

At $1/user/month:

- 1M users = $12M/year
- 100M users = $1.2B/year
- 1B users = $12B/year

Ceiling: everyone who ever talks to AI.

---

| blackboxprogramming.io | Developer Education and APIs | Blackbox-Enterprises |
| blackroad.io | Core Project Landing Page | BlackRoad-OS |
| blackroad.company | Corporate and HR Operations | BlackRoad-Ventures |
| blackroad.me | Personal Agent Identity Nodes | BlackRoad-AI |
| blackroad.network | Distributed Network Interface | BlackRoad-Cloud |
| blackroad.systems | Infrastructure and System Ops | BlackRoad-Cloud |
| blackroadai.com | AI Research and API Hosting | BlackRoad-AI |
| blackroadinc.us | US-based Governance and Legal | BlackRoad-Gov |
| blackroadqi.com | Quantum Intelligence Research | BlackRoad-Labs |
| blackroadquantum.com | Primary Quantum Lab Interface | BlackRoad-Labs |

## Rate Limit Mitigation

| Provider | Observed Limit | Mitigation |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| GitHub Copilot | RPM / Token Exhaustion | Redirect to local Raspberry Pi LiteLLM proxy |
| Hugging Face Hub | IP-based Rate Limit | Rotate HF_TOKEN or use authenticated SSH keys |
| Google Drive | Individual User Quota | Use Shared Drives with GSA "Content Manager" role |
| DigitalOcean API | Concurrent Build Limits | Queue tasks via Layer 7 Orchestration |
| Salesforce API | Daily API Request Cap | Batch updates via Data Cloud Streaming Transforms |

---

## roadchain Witnessing Architecture

Every state transition (agent commits, bot routing, task completion) is hashed using SHA-256 and appended to a non-terminating witnessing ledger. This creates an immutable record of "what happened" rather than "what is true."

---

## Implementation Guide

The FastAPI pattern is the starting point:

1. **Expose endpoints** (`/physics/hydrogen`, `/relativity/time-dilation`)
2. **Operator routes** (keyword matching → right function)
3. **Log everything** (JSON audit trail → future ledger)

This is the Operator pattern in miniature. Start with physics, extend to every domain.

---

## Verification

- **Source of Truth:** GitHub (BlackRoad-OS) + Cloudflare
- **Hash Verification:** PS-SHA-∞ (infinite cascade hashing)
- **Authorization:** Alexa's pattern via Claude/ChatGPT
